# VisualStudio Clean Code

This is an EditorConfig based on [Microsoft documents](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/create-portable-custom-editor-options), [Clean Code for .Net](https://github.com/thangchung/clean-code-dotnet) and some code styles that I liked. I really hope it will help me and others to keep our codes, clean and beautiful.
